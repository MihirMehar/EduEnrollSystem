Description:

The following configuration properties are mutually exclusive:

	management.endpoint.prometheus.access
	management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled

However, more than one of those properties has been configured at the same time:

	management.endpoint.prometheus.access (originating from 'class path resource [application.yml] - 37:15')
	management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled (originating from 'class path resource [application.yml] - 36:16')


Action:

Update your configuration so that only one of the mutually exclusive properties is configured.
